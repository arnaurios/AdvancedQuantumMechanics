    "# Time evolution of harmonic oscillator states in real space\n",
    "This computational notebook provides the tools to prepare harmonic oscillator states in one dimensional space. One can then shift the position of these states or excite them with a given momentum, to observed the real-time dynamics of the states. This is useful for a variety of aspects, but particularly for coherent states. "

    "## Split operator method\n",
    "This notebook solves the dynamics of the Harmonic Oscillator (HO) in a 1D grid in space. This is set-up as a vector of $N_x=100$ points from $x=-6$ to $x=+6$ in HO units. The time evolution is obtained using the Split-Operator Method. Here, one splits the HO hamiltonian $\\hat H=\\hat K + \\hat U$ into kinetic $\\hat K = \\frac{\\hat p^2}{2}$ and potential $\\hat U = \\frac{\\hat x^2}{2}$ terms. The time evolution operator is formally written as $\\hat U(\\delta t)=e^{-i \\hat H \\delta t}$. One can also define time evolution operators for the split parts of the hamiltonian, so that $\\hat U_p(\\delta t)=e^{-i \\hat K \\delta t}$ is diagonal in momentum space and associated to the kinetic energy, and $\\hat U_x(\\delta t)=e^{-i \\hat U \\delta t}$ is diagonal in real space and linked to the potential energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time evolution starts with an eigenstate of the Harmonic Oscillator in real space, $\\psi_n(x,t=0)$. One would like to apply the full operator $\\hat U(\\delta t)$ on this wave function, but this is not straightforward because $\\hat K$ cannot be easily expressed in real space. The Split Operator Method consists in using the replacement\n",
    "$$ \\hat U(\\delta t) \\approx \\hat U_x(\\delta t/2) \\hat U_p(\\delta t) \\hat U_x(\\delta t/2)$$\n",
    "which is valid for sufficiently small $\\delta t$. Note that now each term is independently diagonal in real or momentum space. For instance, the real space part consists simply in multiplying by a phase, \n",
    "$$ \\hat U_x(\\delta t/2) \\psi_n(x,t) = e^{-i \\frac{x \\delta t}{4} }\\psi_n(x,t). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the operator in momentum space, one can transform the wave function into momentum space, \n",
    "$\\psi_n(p,t) = FT \\{ \\psi_n(x,t) \\}$. This can be done efficiently by performing a Fast Fourier Transform on the discrete grid of points in real space. This requires some careful manipulation of the indices in the grid in real and momentum space, which is discussed below. With the wavefunction in momentum space, the small time step in the momentum representation is again just a phase multiplication, $$ \\hat U_p(\\delta t) \\psi_n(p,t) = e^{-i \\frac{p}{2}\\delta t}\\psi_n(p,t=0). $$"
