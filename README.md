These Jupyter Notebooks have been devised to provide some further insight into different sections of the course.

## Harmonic Oscillator: dynamics
This notebook provides the time evolution of harmonic oscillator eigenstates over time, after an initial displacement in real or momentum space. You can launch it from the Notebook above
