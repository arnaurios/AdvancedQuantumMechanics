l# AdvancedQuantumMechanics

These Jupyter Notebooks have been devised to provide some further insight into different sections of the course
[Advanced Quantum Mechanics](http://grad.ub.edu/grad3/plae/AccesInformePDInfes?curs=2022&assig=574634&ens=MD70D&recurs=pladocent&n2=1&idioma=ENG) in the
[Quantum Science and Technology Master's](https://quantummasterbarcelona.eu/) program.

## Harmonic Oscillator: dynamics
This notebook provides the time evolution of harmonic oscillator eigenstates over time, after an initial displacement in real or momentum space.
You can launch it from the Notebook above
[Dynamics_harmonic_oscillator.ipynb](Dynamics_harmonic_oscillator.ipynb)
, or using the Binder link:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/arnaurios/AdvancedQuantumMechanics/main?labpath=Dynamics_harmonic_oscillator.ipynb)

## Scattering: Born approximation
This notebook provides some useful plots for the elastic scattering cross section using the Yukawa or the Coulomb interaction.
You can launch it from the Notebook above
[Scattering_Born_Yukawa.ipynb](Scattering_Born_Yukawa.ipynb)
, or using the Binder link:

## Scattering: repulsive and attractive step well
This notebook provides some useful cases of scattering within the partial wave formalism. The S=0 attractive and repulsive wells are discussed here.
You can launch it from the Notebook above

## Scattering: hard spheres
This notebook provides some useful cases of scattering within the partial wave formalism. The S=0 attractive and repulsive wells are discussed here.
